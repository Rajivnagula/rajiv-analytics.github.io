Sai Rajiv

Business Analyst | Analytics & Decision Support

I translate business problems into decision-ready metrics and dashboards that improve operational visibility and support product decision-making. My experience focuses on defect and quality analytics, where I identify recurring issues, quantify release risk, and deliver actionable insights for stakeholders.

📊 Project: Defect Analytics & Release Risk Dashboard
Business Context

Product and QA teams lacked a consistent, metric-driven view of recurring defects, leading to reactive release decisions and limited visibility into product risk.

Role & Outcome

As the Business Analyst, I defined core KPIs and designed an interactive analytics dashboard that transformed defect records into a consolidated, release-level view of product quality and risk. The solution highlights high-risk components, surfaces recurring defect patterns, and provides a shared fact base for release planning and prioritization discussions.

Key Metrics Defined

Defect Recurrence Rate (by component and release)

Severity Distribution and trend analysis

Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
