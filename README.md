## Project 1: Defect Recurrence & Release Risk Analysis

**Problem**  
Product teams often lack clear visibility into recurring defects, severity trends, and data quality issues before release, increasing operational risk and delaying decisions.

**What I Did**
- Defined analyst-focused metrics such as defect recurrence rate, severity distribution, resolution time, and data quality indicators.
- Explored patterns in simulated operational defect data to identify high-risk components and releases.
- Designed an internal-style analytics dashboard to support prioritization and release planning decisions.

**Key Insights**
- A small number of components accounted for a disproportionate share of recurring critical defects.
- High defect load releases correlated with longer resolution times.
- Missing ownership and description fields materially reduced the reliability of downstream analysis.

**Artifact**
- Interactive dashboard: https://bug-patterns.emergent.host/

> *Note: This is an analyst-led case study using simulated data for demonstration purposes. The focus is on analytical reasoning and decision support, not engineering implementation.*
